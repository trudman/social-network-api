# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This project was my attempt at creating a MongoDB backend using NoSQL to handle CRUD operations. This was very helpful to become more comfortable with NoSQL and creating routes/handling data. This social network API allows users to share thoughts, react to other users thoughts and become friends. This project enabled me to critically think in order to get the routes correctly running while making various calls. This project also allowed me to become more comfortable using Mongoose.

## Installation

1. NPM Install
2. nodemon server.js
3. Navigate to Insomnia to perform GET, POST, PUT, DEL requests

## Usage

To use this application please follow the installation steps above. Once the program is running you can navigate to Insomnia to perform GET, POST, PUT, DEL requests to interact with the database. Below are links to the repository and a video of the functionality.
